## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
The HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript parts of this project were not much of a challenge for me. The real challenge was working with the React library on a solo project for the first time. Working on this simple project has really helped me see the usefulness of a component based development process and allowed me to familiarize myself with all the other nifty features that React offers, such as the useState and useEffect hooks. 

### Continued development
I plan to focus on learning how to implement other useful React features in future projects, as well as writing more maintainable and concise code.
